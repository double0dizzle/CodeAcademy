Between
The BETWEEN operator can be used in a WHERE clause to filter the result set within a certain range. The values can be numbers, text or dates.

This statement filters the result set to only include movies with names that begin with letters 'A' up to, but not including 'J'.

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE name BETWEEN 'A' AND 'J';
Here is another one:

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999;
In this statement, the BETWEEN operator is being used to filter the result set to only include movies with years between 1990 up to, and including 1999.

Really interesting point to emphasize again:

BETWEEN two letters is not inclusive of the 2nd letter.
BETWEEN two numbers is inclusive of the 2nd number.



SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE name BETWEEN 'D' AND 'G';

SELECT *
FROM movies
WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979;
