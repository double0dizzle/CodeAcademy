Relational Databases
Nice work! In one line of code, you returned information from a relational database.

SELECT * FROM celebs;
We'll take a look at what this code means soon, for now, let's focus on what relational databases are and how they are organized.

A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables. Here, the relational database contains one table. 

A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as relations. Here the table is celebs. 

A column is a set of data values of a particular type. Here, id, name, and age are the columns. 

A row is a single record in a table. The first row in the celebs table has:

An id of 1
A name of Justin Bieber
An age of 22
All data stored in a relational database is of a certain data type. Some of the most common data types are:

INTEGER, a positive or negative whole number
TEXT, a text string
DATE, the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD for the year, month, and day
REAL, a decimal value 







Statements
The code below is a SQL statement. A statement is text that the database recognizes as a valid command. Statements always end in a semicolon ;.

CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type, 
   column_2 data_type, 
   column_3 data_type
);
Let's break down the components of a statement:

CREATE TABLE is a clause. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.
table_name refers to the name of the table that the command is applied to.
(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type) is a parameter. A parameter is a list of columns, data types, or values that are passed to a clause as an argument. Here, the parameter is a list of column names and the associated data type.
The structure of SQL statements vary. The number of lines used does not matter. A statement can be written all on one line, or split up across multiple lines if it makes it easier to read. In this course, you will become familiar with the structure of common statements.
