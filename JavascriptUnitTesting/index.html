<!-- Introduction
Imagine checking your bank account online. You have $1,000. The website is updated overnight, and you check again in the morning. Your balance is $257.43. Where did your money go? Is that truly your balance?

You report this to customer service. Thousands of other users report similar issues. Customers close accounts.

Back at the bank a software error is found to be the cause. The bankâ€™s developers did not run tests on the software before deploying it to users. Money did not vanish but its amounts were printed incorrectly to the website.

Errors in software are inevitable. Unchecked, these errors can have painful and costly impacts on users and developers. In 2002, a study commissioned by the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded that software errors cost the US economy about $59 billion annually.

To avoid those costs, software professionals use automated testing. During and after production, they can run an automated test suite to give themselves confidence that their products are free of errors and work as expected.

This lesson will give you the knowledge and practice to discuss these concepts. By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

Define an automated test suite
Describe how a test suite is used in software development
Explain the benefits of automated testing -->

<!-- Manual Testing
Software testing is the process of assessing the completeness and quality of computer software. Usually this is done by running a part of a system (like a web application) and comparing the actual behavior to the expected behavior.

One way to perform software testing is manual testing. Manual testing is a form of testing done by a human interacting with a system. With web apps, this might be clicking, dragging, and typing through a webpage. A list of actions and expected behaviors would be given. If the observed behavior doesn't match the expected behavior, the application has an error.

Errors, like the ones you may have found in the provided web app, are also called bugs. A bug is an error, fault, or flaw in software that makes a system behave in unexpected ways. As you read in the last exercise, these unexpected behaviors can cause harm to users. Ideally testing catches bugs before they are sent to users.

Instructions
The same application is provided. As a manual test engineer for this app, you have been provided some features to test. Manually test the web app by following the list provided:

Behavior 1: Run npm start in the terminal and reload the page. Scroll down and expect the webpage to start with a blank order.
Behavior 2: Type a name and click "Place Order". Scroll down and expect "Deliver to:" to display the submitted name.
Behavior 3: A blank name will not overwrite the existing name.
Behavior 4: Select a cake type and place the order. Expect "Cake" to display the selected cake type.
Behavior 5: Check some fillings. Expect "Fillings" to display your selected fillings.
Behavior 6: Choose a stack size. Expect "Pancake Count:" to display the number equivalent to the stack size, e.g. "Double" is "2". -->
