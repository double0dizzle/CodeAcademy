git commit
A commit is the last step in our Git workflow. A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository.

git commit is the command we'll do next. However, one more bit of code is needed for a commit: the option -m followed by a message. Here's an example:

git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"
Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:

Must be in quotation marks
Written in the present tense
Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m
