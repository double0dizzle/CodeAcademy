git branch 2
Right now, the Git project has only one branch: master.

To create a new branch, use:

git branch new_branch
Here new_branch would be the name of the new branch you create, like photos or blurb. Be sure to name your branch something that describes the purpose of the branch. Also, branch names canâ€™t contain whitespaces: new-branch and new_branch are valid branch names, but new branch is not.
