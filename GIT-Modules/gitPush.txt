git push
Now it's time to share our work with Sally.

The command:

git push origin your_branch_name
will push your branch up to the remote, origin. From there, Sally can review your branch and merge your work into the master branch, making it part of the definitive project version.

Instructions
1.
Enter this command

cd my-quizzes
to change directories into the my-quizzes directory.

2.
Push your branch up to the remote.

In the output, notice the line:

To /home/ccuser/workspace/curriculum/science-quizzes
 * [new branch]      bio-questions -> bio-questions
Git informs us that the branch bio-questions was pushed up to the remote. Sally can now review your new work and can merge it into the remote's master branch.
