git reset II
Creating a project is like hiking in a forest. Sometimes you take a wrong turn and find yourself lost.

Just like retracing your steps on that hike, Git enables you to rewind to the part before you made the wrong turn. You can do this with:

git reset commit_SHA
This command works by using the first 7 characters of the SHA of a previous commit. For example, if the SHA of the previous commit is 5d692065cf51a2f50ea8e7b19b5a7ae512f633ba, use:

git reset 5d69206
HEAD is now set to that previous commit.
