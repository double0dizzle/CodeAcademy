Recipe Book
Let’s continue practicing our Git collaboration skills.

In this project, you’ll be playing the role of two collaborators working on a recipe book.

If you get stuck during this project, check out the project walkthrough video which can be found at the bottom of the page after the final step of the project.

1.
Go into the veggie-favorites remote by using the cd command:

cd veggie-favorites
2.
Once inside veggie-favorites make a change to chili.txt and/or squash-lasagna.txt in the code editor.

Click Save, add your changes to the Git staging area, and then make a commit.

3.
Go into your clone with:

cd ../veggie-clone
Check out Codecademy's Command Line course here to learn more about cd ..

4.
Fetch all new work from the remote.

5.
Merge origin/master into your local master branch .

6.
Create a new branch, then switch over to it to work on new-recipe.txt. The recipe can be whatever dish you'd like.

Click Save.

7.
Add your file changes to the staging area and make a commit.

8.
Fetch one more time just for good measure (there won’t be a change).

9.
Push your branch up to the remote.

10.
Navigate back to the remote with:

cd ../veggie-favorites
Confirm the presence of your new Git branch there.
