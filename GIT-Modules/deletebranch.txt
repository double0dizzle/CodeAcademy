delete branch
In Git, branches are usually a means to an end. You create them to work on a new project feature, but the end goal is to merge that feature into the master branch. After the branch has been integrated into master, it has served its purpose and can be deleted.

The command

git branch -d branch_name
will delete the specified branch from your Git project.

Now that master contains all the file changes that were in fencing, let's delete fencing.
