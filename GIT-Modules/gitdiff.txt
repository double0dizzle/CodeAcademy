git diff
Good work! Now you know how to add a file to the staging area.

Imagine that we type another line in scene-1.txt. Since the file is tracked, we can check the differences between the working directory and the staging area with:

git diff filename
Here, filename is the actual name of the file. If the name of my file was changes.txt the command would be

git diff changes.txt
