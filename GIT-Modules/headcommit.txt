head commit
In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit.

To see the HEAD commit, enter:

git show HEAD
The output of this command will display everything the git log command displays for the HEAD commit, plus all the file changes that were committed.
