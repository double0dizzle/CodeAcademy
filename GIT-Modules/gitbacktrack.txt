git reset review
To better understand git reset commit_SHA, notice the diagram on the right. Each circle represents a commit.

Before reset:

HEAD is at the most recent commit
After resetting:

HEAD goes to a previously made commit of your choice
The gray commits are no longer part of your project
You have in essence rewound the project's history



Generalizations
Congratulations! You've learned three different ways to backtrack in Git. You can use these skills to undo changes made to your Git project.

Let's take a moment to review the new commands:

git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.
Additionally, you learned a way to add multiple files to the staging area with a single command:

git add filename_1 filename_2
