git fetch
After you cloned science-quizzes, you had to run off to teach a class. Now that you're back at your computer, there's a problem: what if, while you were teaching, Sally changed the science-quizzes Git project in some way. If so, your clone will no longer be up-to-date.

An easy way to see if changes have been made to the remote and bring the changes down to your local copy is with:

git fetch
This command will not merge changes from the remote into your local repository. It brings those changes onto what's called a remote branch. Learn more about how this works below.

Instructions
1.
Enter this command:

cd my-quizzes
to go into the my-quizzes directory.

2.
Fetch any new changes Sally may have made to the remote.

$ cd my-quizzes
$ git fetch
