git merge
What if you wanted include all the changes made to the fencing branch on the master branch? We can easily accomplish this by merging the branch into master with:

git merge branch_name
For example, if I wanted to merge the skills branch to master, I would enter

git merge skills
In a moment, you'll merge branches. Keep in mind:

Your goal is to update master with changes you made to fencing.
fencing is the giver branch, since it provides the changes.
master is the receiver branch, since it accepts those changes.
Instructions
1.
You are currently on the fencing branch. Switch over to the master branch.

2.
Your sword-fighting experience is so impressive that it belongs on the master version of your resum√©.

From the terminal, merge the fencing branch into the master branch.

Notice the output: The merge is a "fast forward" because Git recognizes that fencing contains the most recent commit. Git fast forwards master to be up to date with fencing.
