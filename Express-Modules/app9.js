// Matching By HTTP Verb
// Express matches routes using both path and HTTP method verb. 
// In the diagram to the right, we see a request with a PUT verb and /expressions (remember that the query is not part of the route path). 
// The path for the first route matches, but the method verb is wrong, so the Express server will continue to the next registered route. 
// This route matches both method and path, and so its callback is called, the necessary updating logic is executed, and the response is sent.
