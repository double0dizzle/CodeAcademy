// What is an Event?
// When you refresh your email inbox, double tap on a post, or scroll through a newsfeed — something cool happens in your browser. These actions are known as events!

// Events on the web are user interactions and browser manipulations that you can program to trigger functionality. Some examples of events are:

// A mouse clicking on a button
// Webpage files loading in the browser
// A user swiping right on an image
// You can create interactivity on a website by assigning a function to respond to a specific event firing, or triggering. In this lesson, you'll learn to use JavaScript with events to create dynamic websites.

// Instructions
// Check out the recipe webpage — you can play around with the events and their specific functions!

// Increase the measurements of the ingredients by clicking the + button.
// Hover over the instructions to see the estimated cook time.
