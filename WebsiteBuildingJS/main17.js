// Implementing Handlebars
// Watch the video to get an in-depth overview of the code used in the previous exercise. In case you want to watch it at a later time, here is the YouTube link.

// The major steps of using Handlebars in a project:

// Add the Handlebars library to your project. â€” one option is to use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): MDN CDN documentation.
// Create a Handlebars script in your HTML file.
// In your JavaScript file, grab the HTML stored in the Handlebars script.
// Use Handlebars.compile() to return a templating function.
// Pass in a context object to the templating function to get a compiled template.
// Render the compiled template onto the web page.
