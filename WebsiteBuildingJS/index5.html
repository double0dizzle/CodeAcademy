<!-- Parent Child Relationships in the DOM
Following the metaphor of a family tree, let's define some key terminology in the DOM hierarchy:

A parent node is the closet connected node to another node in the direction towards the root.

A child node is the closest connected node to another node in the direction away from the root.

Knowing these terms will allow you to understand and discuss the DOM as a tree-like structure. In fact, you will also see this terminology used when referring to the nesting structure of HTML code. Programmers refer to elements nested inside other elements as the children elements and parent elements respectively.

Instructions
1.
Add the appropriate HTML elements to the index.html file so that it reflects the tree-diagram on the far right.

Start by adding the <title> element. Make sure to nest the tags correctly, so that the nodes follow the illustrated parent-child relationships.

2.
Add the <div> element to index.html so that it reflects the DOM diagram to the right. -->


        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>	
            <head>
            <title> the title </title>
            </head>
        
            <body>
            <h1>The heading</h1>
                <div>
                <p>A summary</p>
                <p>A description</p>
            </div>
            </body>
        </html>



        Review
<!-- Congratulations on completing our introduction to the Document Object Model, or DOM, as a structure!

Let's review what you've learned so far:

The DOM is a structural model of a web page that allows for scripting languages to access that page.
The system of organization in the DOM mimics the nesting structure of an HTML document.
Elements nested within another are referred to as the children of that element. The element they are nested within is called the parent element of those elements.
The DOM also allows access to the regular attributes of an HTML element such as its style, id, etc.
With this understanding, you can begin to leverage the power of scripting languages to create, update, and maintain webpages! -->
